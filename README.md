# HughsWebsite
This is a website I'm building for my friend (and to get a good refresher on building websites using Django and Docker).


# This website should have the following functionality:

- You should be able to see all products and contact info (google map location)
- You should be able to sign-in, or browse as a guest
- You should be able to add products to your cart
- You should be able to purchase said items in the cart using paypal or a credit card (this is functionality I need to research)
- User history should be availible, as well as a button that says (Last Order), with the customers last order in it.
